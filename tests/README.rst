To run tests, invoke ``pytest``, no arguments necessary. Either the root of the repository or the ``tests/`` subdirectory is fine.

``pytest`` does not seem to install executables that discrimate among Python versions. Use the ``-m pytest`` with the interpreter or invocation of ``py`` of your choice to test against other versions.
